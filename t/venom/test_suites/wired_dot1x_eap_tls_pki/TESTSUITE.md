# wired_dot1x_eap_tls_manual

## Requirements
N/A

### Global config steps
1. Create dot1x_eap_tls_manual role
1. Test it against dot1x_eap_tls_pki role

## Scenario steps
1. Create Root CA
1. Create RADIUS server certificate template
1. Create Web server certificate template
1. Create user certificate template
1. Generate RADIUS server certificate to be used by RADIUS services
1. Generate Web server certificate to be used by web admin and captive portal
1. Generate user certificate to be used by node01 with EAP-TLS
1. Install Root CA + RADIUS server certificates (public certificate and
   private key) on PacketFence
1. Configure OCSP to check certificate revocation against pfpki
1. Join domain
1. Configure REALMS
1. Create and test AD sources
1. Create connection profile with auto-registration, AD sources, specific
   filter and `unreg_on_accounting_stop`
1. Restart radiusd services
1. Install Root CA + Web server certificates (public certificate and private key) on PacketFence
1. Restart web services (only haproxy-portal and haproxy-admin)
1. Create EAPTLS source with conditions on user certificate that assign
   dot1x_eap_tls
1. Create connection profile with auto-registration, unreg_on_accounting_stop,
   EAPTLS source and specific filter
1. Perform Checkup (common test suite)
1. Configure 802.1X only and dynamic VLAN on dot1x interface on
   switch01
1. Install Root CA on node01 
1. Install user certificates (public certificate and private key) on node01
   with following paths:
   - ca_cert: /etc/wpa_supplicant/eap_tls/ca.pem
   - client_cert: /etc/wpa_supplicant/eap_tls/client.pem
   - private_key: /etc/wpa_supplicant/eap_tls/client.key
1. Start wpa_supplicant *on* node01 with eap_tls configuration
1. Check RADIUS audit log for node01 (common)
1. Check node status for node01 (common)
1. Check VLAN assigned to node01 *on* switch01 (common)
1. Check Internet access *on* node01 (common)

### TODO:
1. Install certificates (HTTP and RADIUS), generated by pfpki, using API (in
   place of command line)
1. Revoke certificate
1. Kill wpasupplicant (common test suite)
1. Rerun wpasupplicant to have a reject authentication due to revoke certificate
1. Check RADIUS audit log for node01 (common) = reject
1. Check node status for node01 (common) = registered
1. Check VLAN assigned to node01 *on* switch01 (common) = NOT AUTHORIZED
1. Check Internet access *on* node01 (common) = down

## Teardown steps
1. Kill wpa_supplicant: an accounting stop will be generated if we wait
   EAP-TIMEOUT on the switch (not the case here due to next task). Access is
   still working until we run next task.
1. Unconfigure switch port and dynamic VLAN on switch01
   1. Generate a RADIUS Accounting stop message (sent by switch01) which update
      `last_seen` attribute of node01 and unreg device based on
      `unreg_on_accounting_stop`
   1. Don't send a RADIUS Disconnect message
1. Check online status of node01: should be offline due to accounting stop
1. Check node status for node01
1. Wait `delete_windows` + 10 seconds before running `node_cleanup` task
1. Delete node by running `pfcron's node_cleanup` task
1. Check node has been deleted
1. Disable `node_cleanup` task
1. Restart `pfcron` to take change into account
1. Delete connection profile, EAPTLS source, OCSP profile and configuration
1. Restart RADIUS services (common test suite)

## Additional notes

Reauthentication is done by switch based on `eap_reauth_period` setting to
avoid node been unregistered when it reach unregdate and automatically deleted
by `pfcron` without running teardown steps.
